## Overview üåü

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that recommends tourist activities in Djerba based on user inputs such as:
- Tourist Type (Solo, Couple, Family, Group)
- Interest Category (Relaxation, Adventure, Culture)
- Budget (Low, Medium, High)
- Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
- Duration of Stay (Short, Medium, Long)
- Accessibility (Walking, Public Transport, Car Rental)

The system uses a **RandomForestClassifier** with **SMOTE** for handling class imbalance and achieves an accuracy of **over 90%**!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored activity suggestions based on user preferences.
- **High Accuracy**: Machine learning model with >90% accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.
- **Handles Class Imbalance**: Uses SMOTE to ensure balanced predictions.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is one-hot encoded to convert categorical features into numeric values.
   - SMOTE is applied to handle class imbalance in the target variable.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A **RandomForestClassifier** is trained using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
   - The model is evaluated on a test set to ensure high accuracy.

3. **Recommendation System**:
   - Users input their preferences via the Streamlit interface.
   - The model predicts the top 3 activities with confidence scores.

## Tech Stack üíª

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning (RandomForestClassifier, GridSearchCV).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)**: For handling class imbalance.
